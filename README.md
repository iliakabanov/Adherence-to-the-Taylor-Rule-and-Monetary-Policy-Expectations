# Monetary-Policy-Expectations
In current paper my collegues and I carried out a research on monetary policy of Russian Central Bank. In this project I was responsible for the second part that was dedicated to public expectations about this policy. I used quotes of USD/RUB future contracts in 30-minutes window during which CB press-release was publiched.   

To tackle this issue following steps are undertaken: 
* 'Monetary surprise' calculation
* Application of macroeconomic theoretical model (a small open economy with a perfect capital mobility)
* Econometric analysis for structural shift detection

Conclusion: decisions meade by Russian Central Bank are predominantly mispredicted by public.
